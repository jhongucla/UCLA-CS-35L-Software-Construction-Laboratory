I started by downloading the Coreutils 7.6 package using the command
> wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
and unzipped it using the command
> tar -zxvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 

I then made a directory to install the package in using the command
> mkdir Coreutilsinstall

Then I configured the package so it would install in the directory 
I made using the command
> ./configure  --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/jianan/CoreutilsInstall

Finally I could compile and install the package using the commands
> make
> make install

After the package is installed, we can reproduce the broken ls bug 
by running the ls program included in the package by using the 
following commands
> cd CoreutilsInstall/bin
> ./ls -l

The next step is to create a patch file which I accomplished by 
using emacs to create a file mypatch with the copied text from 
Brady's patch. I placed the file in the coreutils-7.6 directory 
and using the following command to apply the patch
> patch -p1 < mypatch

I then ran make again and then ran the ls program in the 
/coreutils-7.6/src directory to observe that the data format has been fixed. 

The command that was run as a result of using make was make 
all-recursive. This command goes through each directory in 
coreutils-7.6 and sees if there are any changes in the source 
files based on the Makefile. It found that the only changes 
made were in the src folder and only recompiled those files. 
We only used make and not make install because we want to 
have two copies of coreutils, one in the CoreutilsInstall 
directory and another in the coreutils-7.6/src directory. 
The first copy has the ls bug while the second one is patched. 

To test that the change fixes the bug, I created two directories, 
new and old, and marked the old directory to be 20 years old 
using the following commands
> mkdir new
> mkdir old
> touch -t 9612071200

I then ran the two versions of ls, one in CoreutilsInstall and 
the other in coreutils-7.6/bin and compared the results.

> ~/CoreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  2 jianan csugrad     4096 2017-01-25 19:24 new
drwxr-xr-x  2 jianan csugrad     4096 1996-12-07 12:00 oldu 

> ~/coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  2 jianan csugrad     4096 Jan 25 19:24 new
drwxr-xr-x  2 jianan csugrad     4096 Dec  7  1996 old

The English format date doesnâ€™t include the year when the file is 
less than an year old while it does when the file is greater than 
a year old.
