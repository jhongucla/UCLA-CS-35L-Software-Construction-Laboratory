Q1.
Brady removed the line most likely to clean up the code. 
Since the line is repeated twice and is part of a switch 
statement, having the line twice would not make a 
difference, since execution would fall through to 
the second line anyway. Therefore it is not necessary 
to remove the line.

Q2.
The patched version displays the date in a format 
familiar to the English speaking world, but it may be 
foreign to users who donâ€™t speak English and are not 
familiar with English-format dates. International users 
could have trouble interpreting the output of ls -l. 
Another issue that could arise is that programs and 
scripts that depend on the specific date format in the 
unpatched version could now produce unpredictable results 
now that the format has been changed. 

Q3.
If we invoke randline.py on an empty file like /dev/null, 
we get output such as
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.12/lib/python2.7/random.py", 
line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  
# raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range
This is because randline.py assumes that the file is not 
empty so seq must have something in it. If invoked on an 
empty file, seq is empty and we get an index error.

Q4.
When randline.py is invoked with Python 3, the following 
is outputted:
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
This occurs because in Python 3, automatic tuple unpacking 
has been deprecated. Therefore, the syntax for passing in 
a tuple to an exception is invalid in Python 3.
