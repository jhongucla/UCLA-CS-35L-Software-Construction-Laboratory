I used the time command to compare the performance of sfrob, sfrobu, scrubs, sfrobu -u, and sfrobs -f.

I created a text file with 100 lines and ran with it with each program.

> time ./sfrob < test.txt

real	0m0.012s
user	0m0.004s
sys	0m0.002s

> time ./sfrobu < test.txt

real	0m0.017s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.009s

> time ./sfrobs < test.txt

real	0m0.053s
user	0m0.035s
sys	0m0.018s

> time ./sfrobu -f < test.txt

real	0m0.016s
user	0m0.005s
sys	0m0.008s

> time ./sfrobs -f < test.txt

real	0m0.032s
user	0m0.035s
sys	0m0.014s

We can see that sfrob has a lower sys time than sfrobu since it makes much fewer system calls. However the real times are quite similar for both programs. 
It seems that the addition of the -f option doesn’t significantly change the times as expected since changing to uppercase doesn’t really impact the times. 
sfrobs is the slowest program since it runs in bash which is much slower than the C code in sfrob and sfrobu.
